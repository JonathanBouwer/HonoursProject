# HonoursProject
Repository for code and graphs for UCT Computer Science Honours Project

## Requirements
- Tested on Tensor Flow 1.8.0 but should work for any higher version
- All code has been tested on Python 3.6.5, but should work for all python versions which support Tensor Flow 1.8.0

## Usage
All scripts can be easily edited by modifying the constant variables near the top of the file.

## Scripts
- gan.py: This is the script which trains and runs GANs, modify the final 2 lines to switch between both training and running and just running.
- nueral_net.py: This is the script which trains classification networks for comparison
- analyze.py: This is the script which calculates avaerages and ranges based on the generated data
